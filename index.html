                <p class="description">
                    ☛ Yuno was born to Loyce and Ciel of House Grinberryall, the royal family of the Spade Kingdom. As an infant, Yuno is given a magic stone found in a Grand Magic Zone.<br><br>
                    ☛ Later that year, the Zogratis siblings attacked the royal castle and killed many of the royals. Knowing that Yuno will be killed if he was found, some members of the Mage Defense Force escaped with the infant, and Ralph Niaflem's father carried Yuno across the Grand Magic Zone between the Spade Kingdom and the Clover Kingdom. Upon arriving at the village of Hage, the mage used the last of his magic to deliver Yuno to the front of the church before collapsing to his death.<br><br>
                    ☛ As an orphan, Yuno spent his childhood in the church and grew along with Asta and the other orphans. One day, during a trip home after grocery shopping with his foster family, Yuno overheard a few villagers talking about life in the Noble Realm of the Kingdom. After Sister Lily explained the social status within the Kingdom, Yuno hears Asta's dream to become the Wizard King for the first time.<br><br>
                    ☛ Years later, Yuno still lives at the church, where he takes care of chores such as doing laundry, chopping firewood, or taking care of the younger children. When he turns 15 years old, Yuno receives a four-leaf clover grimoire during the Grimoire Acceptance Ceremony. He declares his ambition to the public while brushing off Asta's declaration of rivalry. Later that day, Yuno is confronted by Revchi Salik, who manages to snatch his grimoire and immobilizes Yuno with his Chain Magic. Once again, Asta steps in to save him, which prompts Yuno to clarify his previous statement during the ceremony and declares Asta as his rival.<br><br>
                    ☛ <strong>Sylph</strong><br>
                    Sylph is one of the four main elemental spirits who chose Yuno during the battle at the dungeon. She likes Yuno and has a possessive attitude. However, Yuno acts detached from her chatty behavior and usually refuses to respond to her comments, pretending she does not exist whenever she gets frustrated with him. While in battle, Yuno chooses only to speak to Sylph through instructions or simple answers.
